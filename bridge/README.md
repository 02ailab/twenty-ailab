# twenty-bridge — Chatwoot ↔ Twenty integration service

Standalone service that bridges the live **Chatwoot** (`chat.saldo.chat`) and
**Twenty CRM** (`crm.saldo.chat`) on the Saldo k3s cluster. It does **not** modify
either fork — it talks to both over the network.

## Scope

**Iteration 1 — Chatwoot → Twenty:**

- on Chatwoot `contact_created` / `contact_updated` / `conversation_created`, upsert
  a **Person** (+ linked **Company**) in Twenty. Store the Twenty id back on the
  Chatwoot contact (`additional_attributes.external.twenty_id`) and in the bridge DB.
- **Panel**: a Chatwoot **Dashboard App** iframe showing the contact's Twenty card.
  Admin-only — Chatwoot serves the Dashboard App to administrators only (server-side,
  fail-closed); the panel itself is secret-gated and never echoes the secret.

**Iteration 2 — Twenty → Chatwoot:**

- **Write-back**: on Twenty `person.updated`, push the basic identity (name / email /
  phone) back onto the **native** Chatwoot contact. Only basic identity — rich Twenty
  CRM data stays in the admin-only panel, so it never leaks to non-admin managers. The
  echo loop is broken by compare-before-write on both sides (skip if unchanged).
- **Chatwoot link on the Twenty card**: the bridge sets a Person "Links" field to the
  contact's Chatwoot conversation URL, so an admin can jump from the CRM card to the chat.

**Iteration 3 — more sync:**

- **Company from email**: when a Chatwoot contact has no `company_name`, derive the Twenty
  Company from a corporate email domain; free-provider / no email → no company (no fake bucket).
- **Conversation → Note**: on a Chatwoot conversation resolve, write the transcript to ONE
  Twenty Note on the contact's Person (one note per conversation, body refreshed on each
  resolve; private/activity messages filtered).

Out of scope (later): migrate the panel from a static URL-secret to a session/one-time token.

## Why all traffic is mostly internal

Chatwoot, Twenty and this bridge all run in the **same k3s cluster**, so:

- Chatwoot → bridge webhooks use cluster DNS (private, no public ingress).
- bridge → Twenty (`http://twenty-server.twenty.svc.cluster.local:3000`) is private.
- bridge → Chatwoot REST (`http://chatwoot.chatwoot.svc.cluster.local`) is private.
- **The panel** needs public HTTPS (it loads in the agent's browser) →
  one Traefik ingress + cert-manager TLS, e.g. `bridge.saldo.chat`.
- **`/webhooks/twenty` is also public** — Twenty's outbound SSRF guard blocks private
  ClusterIPs, so Twenty can only reach the bridge via the public host. The endpoint is
  HMAC-gated and fail-closed (no `TWENTY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` ⇒ rejects). `/webhooks/chatwoot`
  stays internal (Chatwoot reaches it via cluster DNS thanks to `SAFE_FETCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK`).

## Architecture

```text
Chatwoot --webhook(internal)--> /webhooks/chatwoot --> upsert Person/Company --> Twenty
                                                   \--> set Person "Links" -> Chatwoot chat URL
Twenty   --webhook(PUBLIC,HMAC)--> /webhooks/twenty --> write name/email/phone --> Chatwoot
Agent browser --iframe(public)--> /panel?... --> bridge queries Twenty --> CRM card
mapping (chatwoot_contact_id <-> twenty_person_id) stored in the bridge's own Postgres
anti-echo: compare-before-write on BOTH sides (skip if unchanged)
```

## Stack

FastAPI + httpx + own PostgreSQL. Deployed to k3s in its own namespace
(`twenty-bridge`) following `general_docs/SALDO_K3S_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
(WinSCP → docker build on VPS → `k3s ctr images import` → `kubectl apply`).

## Status

**Iteration 1 — LIVE since 2026-06-26** (namespace `twenty-bridge`, panel at
`bridge.saldo.chat`). Chatwoot→Twenty contact+company sync and the Dashboard App
panel work end-to-end in production. Includes code-review hardening: panel auth
(secret validated, no leak; plus `no-referrer` so the panel URL/secret never leaks
to the Twenty origin), strict webhook HMAC, defensive parsing, required config, and
container `securityContext`.

**Iteration 2 — LIVE since 2026-06-27** — Twenty→Chatwoot write-back + Chatwoot
link on the Twenty card. Adds: `/webhooks/twenty` reverse sync (public, HMAC,
fail-closed), compare-before-write anti-echo on both directions, and a best-effort
Person "Links" field populated with the contact's latest Chatwoot conversation URL.

**Iteration 3 — LIVE since 2026-06-27** — company-from-email-domain + Chatwoot
conversation→Twenty Note transcript (one note per conversation, refreshed on each
resolve, private/activity filtered). Requires the Chatwoot account webhook to also
subscribe to `conversation_status_changed`. NoteTarget link uses `personId` (live
Twenty v1.14.0 classic relation).

**Prelaunch hardening (2026-06-29)** — from the prelaunch audit naryad (`general_docs/work_orders/twenty-ailab.md`):

- **Panel (P0-2):** `/panel` entry is still secret-gated, but the page now mints a **short-lived token**
  (HMAC of `PANEL_SHARED_SECRET`, TTL `PANEL_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS`) and the JSON API is called with the
  token — the durable secret no longer rides in `/panel/api` URLs (logs/Referer/history). Secret compares
  are constant-time; the API is per-IP rate-limited (`PANEL_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`). The full
  Chatwoot-signed session token still needs chatwoot-ailab fork edits (operator-gated).
- **Dup-Person race (P1-1):** resolve→create is serialized per contact by a Postgres advisory lock.
- **Replay guard (P1-2):** optional freshness window on `/webhooks/twenty`, default **off**
  (`TWENTY_WEBHOOK_MAX_AGE_SECONDS=0`).
- **HMAC diagnostics (P0-3):** non-secret diagnostics on signature mismatch (the scheme itself is a
  cross-service contract, unchanged). Live verification = trigger a real webhook and watch the logs.
- Name round-trip, transcript pagination, secret-script optionality also fixed (see naryad board).

## Tests

Pure-function unit tests (no DB/HTTP) under `tests/` — run from the bridge dir:

```bash
python -m pytest -q        # 26 tests: panel-token, freshness, HMAC schemes, rate limiter, sync helpers, XFF client-key
```

### Positive-chain probe (orchestration-check `--positive`)

`scripts/orch-positive-b.sh` runs `scripts/orch_positive_b.py` **inside** the api pod
(`kubectl exec -i deploy/twenty-bridge-api -- python -`). It creates a synthetic
`test-orch-*` Chatwoot contact (free-domain email → no Company), fires a `contact_updated`
webhook signed with the live `CHATWOOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (used in-pod, never printed), checks
the bridge returns 200 and a Twenty Person + `contact_map` row appear, re-fires for
idempotency (same person_id), then deletes the Person, mapping row and synthetic contact in
`finally`. The HMAC/payload contract is unchanged — this is a safe test harness the
orchestrator calls from `orchestration-check.sh --positive`. Emits one JSON result line.

## Deploy (operator, WinSCP + PuTTY)

The bridge is custom code, so it is **built on the VPS** (unlike vanilla Twenty).
Per `general_docs/SALDO_K3S_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`:

1. DNS: add A-record `bridge.saldo.chat` → `159.195.80.68` (needed for panel TLS).
2. WinSCP-upload this `bridge/` folder to `/root/twenty-bridge/`.
3. On the VPS: `cd /root/twenty-bridge && cp .env.example .env && nano .env`
   (fill `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `PANEL_SHARED_SECRET`, `CHATWOOT_API_TOKEN`,
   `CHATWOOT_ACCOUNT_ID`, `TWENTY_API_KEY`; for iteration 2 also set
   `TWENTY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — required, the public reverse webhook is fail-closed).
   `CHATWOOT_PUBLIC_URL` / `TWENTY_CHATWOOT_FIELD` default correctly for prod.
4. `bash deploy.sh` — builds the image, imports into k3s, creates the Secret,
   applies manifests, smokes `/healthz`. cert-manager issues `bridge-tls` once DNS
   resolves.

Secret-only refresh (e.g. after the Twenty API key arrives):
`bash deploy.sh --secret-only`.

## Configure Chatwoot (after deploy)

1. **Webhook** (Settings → Integrations → Webhooks, or API) →
   URL `http://twenty-bridge-api.twenty-bridge.svc.cluster.local:8000/webhooks/chatwoot`
   (cluster-internal), events: `contact_created`, `contact_updated`,
   `conversation_created`. Use the same secret as `CHATWOOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
2. **Dashboard App** (Settings → Integrations → Dashboard Apps, or
   `POST /api/v1/accounts/:id/dashboard_apps`) →
   content `[{"type":"frame","url":"https://bridge.saldo.chat/panel?secret=<PANEL_SHARED_SECRET>"}]`.
   The panel then appears in the conversation view and shows the contact's Twenty card.
   `/panel` validates this secret (no fallback). If it is ever exposed, rotate
   `PANEL_SHARED_SECRET`, run a full `bash deploy.sh`, then update this URL via
   `PATCH /api/v1/accounts/:id/dashboard_apps/:id`.

## Backups

Per the platform standard `general_docs/BACKUP_STANDARD.md` (mandatory for all services).
twenty-bridge stores only a mapping DB and no uploaded files, so a **full** backup =
Postgres dump + the encrypted k8s Secret:

- Script: `bridge/deploy/backups/backup-twenty-bridge.sh` → copy to `/root/backups/bin/`
  on the VPS, cron via `/etc/cron.d/saldo-backups` (daily 03:00).
- Output: `/root/backups/twenty-bridge/{db,secrets}/` (DB `*.sql.gz`, Secret `*.yaml.age`),
  retention 7. Secrets are `age`-encrypted; the private key is kept **off** the server.
- Offsite: the platform-wide `offsite-sync.sh` ships the whole `/root/backups` tree weekly
  (stub until `OFFSITE_REMOTE` is set). See the standard for key setup and restore steps.

### Twenty CRM backup (ns `twenty`) — P1-3

Twenty CRM itself (the `twenty-db` Postgres holding **client CRM data**) is backed up by an
**external** host script — Twenty is vanilla upstream, its chart/code is never touched.

- Install: `bash deploy/backups/install-backups-twenty.sh` (idempotent; own cron file
  `/etc/cron.d/saldo-backups-twenty`, daily 03:20, so it never clobbers the bridge cron).
- `backup-twenty.sh`: `pg_dumpall --globals-only` (roles) + `pg_dump -Fc` of every discovered
  app DB (so the DB name isn't guessed and the dump is restore-drill-able) + attachments tar
  from the `twenty-server` PVC + age-encrypted Secrets (`tokens`, `twenty-db-url`,
  `twenty-db-superuser`) → `/root/backups/twenty/{db,files,secrets}/`, retention 7.
- `restore-drill-twenty.sh`: non-destructive validation of the latest dumps; `--full` loads
  the newest archive into a throwaway DB inside the pod and drops it.
- **⚠️ First run:** three live-only assumptions are verified fail-loud in preflight and are
  env-overridable — the `twenty-db-superuser` secret key names (`SUPERUSER_USER_KEY`/
  `SUPERUSER_PASS_KEY`), the attachments path (`TWENTY_STORAGE_PATH`), and object names
  (`TWENTY_DB_DEPLOY`/`TWENTY_SERVER_DEPLOY`). Confirm them on the first `backup-twenty.sh` run.
  Full specifics: `general_docs/BACKUP_STANDARD.md §7.4`.

## Configure Twenty (after deploy — iteration 2)

1. **Person "Links" field** (Settings → Data model → Person → add field) → type
   **Links**, API name `chatwoot` (must match `TWENTY_CHATWOOT_FIELD`). The bridge
   populates it best-effort; if the field is missing it logs `twenty_link_field_unavailable`
   and the rest of the sync still succeeds.
2. **Webhook** (Settings → Developers → Webhooks) → operation `person.updated`
   (optionally `person.created`), target URL **public**
   `https://bridge.saldo.chat/webhooks/twenty` (NOT the cluster-internal address —
   Twenty's SSRF guard blocks private IPs), secret = `TWENTY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
3. **Hairpin check** — confirm Twenty pods can reach the public ingress from inside
   the cluster (single-node k3s usually allows this):
   `kubectl -n twenty exec deploy/twenty-server -- curl -sk -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://bridge.saldo.chat/panel`
   → expect `403` (reached the bridge, secret rejected) — anything other than a
   connection error means the hairpin works and the webhook will be delivered.

### saldoClientId field (F1) — enable when ready

The bridge assigns a per-client number `saldoClientId` (AAAA, from 2000) once when it first
creates a Person (Twenty is the authority of record; the bridge allocates from a Postgres
sequence — there is no native Twenty autonumber). It is **off by default**. To enable:

1. **Person "Number" field** (Settings → Data model → Person → add field) → type **Number**,
   API name `saldoClientId` (must match `TWENTY_SALDO_CLIENT_ID_FIELD`).
2. Set `SALDO_CLIENT_ID_ENABLED=true` in `.env` and run a full `bash deploy.sh`.

With the flag off, the bridge never touches the field, so deploying the code before the field
exists is safe. Once on, new Persons get a unique increasing number; a Person created earlier is
backfilled on its next sync. The forward identity payload never carries this field (no echo loop).
Reverse-sync of the number into Chatwoot `identifier` (**F2**) is held pending an orchestrator
decision on the Chatwoot identifier/merge contract.

## NetworkPolicy (PLAT-2, operator — apply + verify, NOT auto-applied)

`deploy.sh` applies only `twenty-bridge.yaml`. The PLAT-2 NetworkPolicy is a **separate** manifest
because wrong selectors (or a CNI probe quirk) would break the LIVE webhook path. Apply explicitly
and verify nothing broke:

```bash
cd /root/twenty-bridge
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/networkpolicy.yaml
kubectl -n twenty-bridge get pods            # must stay Ready (kubelet probes still pass)
# Then confirm the live paths still work:
#  - trigger a Chatwoot contact_updated  -> expect contact_synced in the bridge logs
#  - open the panel in a Chatwoot conversation -> card loads
#  - hairpin check above still returns 403
```

Rollback if anything regresses: `kubectl -n twenty-bridge delete -f deploy/k8s/networkpolicy.yaml`.
The policy is default-deny ingress + allows for Traefik (kube-system), the `chatwoot` namespace
(internal webhook), and api→postgres. k3s enforces NetworkPolicy via its bundled kube-router
(unless started with `--disable-network-policy`).
